# adblock
Made myself an adblock, and so can you!

# Reason
So there's a vulnerability (and many many custom adblocks there in the store) can have malware in the app. SÃ³ I decided to make my own adblock. That's still in a prototype phase, but it works in most of websites.

# How to Install
(Only Firefox)

Go to URL and type : "about:debugging"
Go to "This Firefox" > "Load Temporary Extension"

Then, load the manifest.json file.

That's it, now our webpages will have adblocking

# Problems
Because it's debugging tool (not in the Online store), the extension need to be loaded everytime the firefox closes.

# Changing
Change it whaterver you want, please do
